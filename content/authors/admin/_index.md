I am currently a postdoctoral associate at the department of Statistical Science at Duke University working under the mentorship of professors David Dunson and Fan Li. Previously, I completed my PhD at Harvard University working with professors Francesca Dominici and Corwn Zigler.

My research interest lie broadly in the fields of causal inference and Bayesian modeling.
I am particularly motivated in providing useful, applicable, and creative solutions to important scientific questions,
and in developing tools that allow researchers to analyze data properly and flexibly..

When I'm not working on statistics, I enjoy running and, more recently, rock climbing.
I love traveling and learning new languages. Within the next few years, I'm hoping to spend time hiking in Mongolia.
