abstract: Causal inference in spatial settings is met with unique challenges and opportunities. On one hand, a unit's outcome can be affected by the exposure at many locations, leading to interference. On the other hand, unmeasured spatial variables can confound the effect of interest. Our work has two overarching goals. First, using causal diagrams, we illustrate that spatial confounding and interference can manifest as each other, meaning that investigating the presence of one can lead to wrongful conclusions in the presence of the other, and that statistical dependencies in the exposure variable can render standard analyses invalid. This can have crucial implications for analyzing data with spatial or other dependencies, and for understanding the effect of interventions on dependent units. Secondly, we propose a parametric approach to mitigate bias from local and neighborhood unmeasured spatial confounding and account for interference simultaneously. This approach is based on simultaneous modeling of the exposure and the outcome while accounting for the presence of spatially-structured unmeasured predictors of both variables. We illustrate our approach with a simulation study and with an analysis of the local and interference effects of sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants on cardiovascular mortality.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We investigate the complications and opportunities when drawing causal inference from spatial observational data. We introduce causal diagrams that allow us to investigate the impact of spatial confounders, interference, and the inherent spatial structure in the exposure variable, and we illustrate that causal inference with spatial data has crucial differences to counterparts with independent observations. We then propose an approach that mitigates bias from unmeasured spatial confounding and incorporates interference within one framework.
